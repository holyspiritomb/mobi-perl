Changes in 0.0.21:

- Added detection of images that are to large in mobi2mobi

- Added flag --fiximagesizes to mobi2mobi so it will fix the
  incorrect image sizes.

- --htmlfile flag for lit2mobi placed file in wrong dir, fixed now.

- Added flag --coveroffset to mobi2mobi and fixed a bug relating to
  this. Now it is possible to change which image that is cover image
  by just specifying another offset.

- The distribution is now a packed directory.

- Added flags --exthtype and --exthdata to mobi2mobi to be able to
  set any type. Values can be set for unknown types 204, 205, 206, 207,
  401, 403. This can help to figure out what these items mean.

Changes in 0.0.20:

- <pre>-tags is now replaced with someting that displays better
  in a MobiPocket reader.

- Changed max file size for images to 61000 to avoid conversion of 
  a BMP image.

- Images are now not converted to jpg if they fit the file size and image size
  requirements.



Changes in 0.0.19:

- Fixed resizing of image data and rescaling of image for
  mobi2mobi. The rescaling is neccessary because of the Gen3
  not working on files with images with width larger than 480
  or something around that size. This seems to be a bug in the
  Gen3.

- Added Image::BMP to Util.pm. Used to convert a file
  from BMP to GD if needed.

- Fixed TOC bug caused by filepos attribute not removed in 
  mobit2html.

- Changed max file size for images to 60000.
  From MobiPocket forum: "- the size of each JPEG image is limited to
  about 63K for a number of technical reasons "

- Fixed filepos bug in html2mobi so now TOC in the beginning works
  for Twain example.

- Fixed mobi2html so it works for the Alice example were the filepos
  point to "<h" instead of pointing to a "<a".
