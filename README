Changes in 0.0.19:

- Fixed resizing of image data and rescaling of image for
  mobi2mobi. The rescaling is neccessary because of the Gen3
  not working on files with images with width larger than 480
  or something around that size. This seems to be a bug in the
  Gen3.

- Added Image::BMP to Util.pm. Used to convert a file
  from BMP to GD if needed.

- Fixed TOC bug caused by filepos attribute not removed in 
  mobit2html.

- Changed max file size for images to 60000.
  From MobiPocket forum: "- the size of each JPEG image is limited to
  about 63K for a number of technical reasons "

- Fixed filepos bug in html2mobi so now TOC in the beginning works
  for Twain example.

- Fixed mobi2html so it works for the Alice example were the filepos
  point to "<h" instead of pointing to a "<a".
